          <h4>My Quick Story</h4>
          <p>
            I thought coding was my thing until I realized I was way more
            interested in what the code revealed than the code itself. My{" "}
            <strong>software engineering certificate</strong> taught me to build
            things, but my math brain wanted to understand the patterns behind
            them. Enter <strong>data analytics</strong> â€”suddenly everything
            clicked. <strong>Python</strong> became my data manipulation tool,{" "}
            <strong>SQL</strong> my new best friend, and{" "}
            <strong>Tableau</strong> my creative outlet. Now I&apos;m the person
            who finds genuine joy in messy datasets and I&apos;m excited to
            bring this passion to real-world business challenges.
